Question: 
>We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/e3f1970eb419b3aa32788a43ec91ef08 and try it out!

Hints:
>Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

Points: 40

First, we get to the directory and list the files:

```
$ ls                                                      
bashloop  flag
```

Permissions here allow us to execute bashloop, but not read from flag. However, bashloop can read from flag. 

Running bashloop outputs:

```
What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096
```
The script takes a command line argument as the number.

As the title suggests, a bash loop is the best way to tackle this problem. Look in the bash loop.sh file for the code. 

the bash loop file can be run from the home directory if given the absolute path of the target bashloop file.

```
Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: 9960332950d7db392f
97f29dee04f4ee
```


anyway, the flag is `9960332950d7db392f97f29dee04f4ee`
