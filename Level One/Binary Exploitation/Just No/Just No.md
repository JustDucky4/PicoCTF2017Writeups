Question: 
>A program at /problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74 has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

Hints:
>Check out the difference between relative and absolute paths and see if you can figure out how to use them to solve this challenge. Could you possibly spoof another auth file it looks at instead...?

Points: 40

Well, in fact, you do have to spoof another auth file!

Inside the directory, there are 4 files:

```
$ ls                                                      
auth  flag  justno  justno.c
```

justno has execution permission, justno.c has read permission, and auth has read permission. Unfortunately, we cannot alter what auth says.


While it might seem like a good idea to change the code for justno.c, compile and run that, it won't have the permissions required to read from flag and cause a segmentation error.

The code for justno.c is viewable in this folder.

There are a few interesting things in the code for justno.c

1.)
`FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/auth","r"); //access auth file in ../../problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74`

2.) 
`flagf = fopen("/problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/flag", "r");`

As you can see, the two files paths are very different. For flaf, the file path is *absolute*. For authf, the file path is *relative*. This means that the file referred to by flagf will be the same no matter what, but the file referred to by authf can change based on where it is called from.

I created a `problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74' directory in my home directory, and placed an `auth` file inside. I had the file read `yes` instead of `no`, but anything other than `no` would have worked.

I then called the justno file that was in `/problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74` from inside the one in my home directory.

While inside my home directory, the path for auth backs up two directories, looks for problems, and then looks for 579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74, both of which are now in my home directory.

From there, it reads my spoofed `auth` file, sees that it says yes, and then calls the flag. 

```
Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's t
he flag: 37df41ffe2da397584c43eabf8a50ee3
```

so, the flag is `37df41ffe2da397584c43eabf8a50ee3`
